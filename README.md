# es6-scaffold

## Angular 1 Branch

This branch demonstrates the set up outlined in [Getting to Next: Using Angular 1.x with JSPM, SystemJS, and ECMAScript 6](http://www.morrissinger.com/using-angular-1-x-with-jspm-systemjs-and-ecmascript-6/). That article points readers to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/morrissinger/a45ceb74ab078c0b14cf) to get the code. This branch takes the files from that gist and puts them in the correct locations in this repository's folder structure.

## Development Instructions

Fork or clone this repository and then:

1. `git checkout angular-1`
2. `npm install`
3. `jspm install`
4. `gulp watch`
5. Open your browser to http://localhost:9000/#/home

You should see a page showing only "Hello, bar!"
